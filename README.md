# Northcoders News API

For instructions, please head over to [L2C NC News](https://l2c.northcoders.com/courses/be/nc-news).

As .env.\* was added to my .gitignore, anyone who wishes to clone your repo will not have access to the necessary environment variables.
To connect to the two databases locally, please add a .env.test file with PGDATABASE=nc_news_test as the contents and a .env.development file with PGDATABASE=nc_news as the contents.
